This website was birthed as an end product from Transformation Office's (TO) participation in the HealthTech Sprint 2023, that was organised by the team from Open Government Products (OGP). Through a Product Accelerator Workshop during the Sprint event, TO and some divisional representatives got hands-on experience with using various OGP tools, including Isomer which was used to create this site.
