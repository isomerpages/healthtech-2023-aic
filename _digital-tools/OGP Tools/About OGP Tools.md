# Open Government Products (OGP)
### About OGP
They are an experimental development team under GovTech that builds technology for the public good. Their role is to accelerate the digital transformation of the Singapore Government by being a space where it can experiment with new tech practices, including new technologies, management techniques, corporate systems, and cultural norms. Read more about OGP [here](https://www.open.gov.sg/).
### About OGP Tools
The OGP Product Suite offers a wide and expanding range of products that solve the needs and pain points of many Singaporeans and Singapore agencies like ours. As of March 2022, OGP Product Suite have been whitelisted by MOH, and made accessible for public healthcare use via the Healthcare Virtual Browswer (*meaning you can access their sites via your corporate laptops, yay!*).

The OGP Tools (*we named it such in replacement of OGP Product Suite*)  that are  available for AIC's use can be found in the subsequent pages. The Transformation Office will continue to update this site to include in more products whenever new offerings come up, and can meet our problem statement.
