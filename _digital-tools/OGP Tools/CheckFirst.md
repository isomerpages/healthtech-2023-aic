## CheckFirst 
### About the tool 
CheckFirst allows users to build eligibility checkers, calculators, and even quizzes. The user interface is similar to that of [FormSG](https://www.transformationoffice.aic.sg/digital-tools/ogp-tools/FormSGsgID/), using an drag and drop for easy formatting. 
### Use Cases
Grant applicants may benefit from having a checker as they can validate whether they are eligible to start with or not. Having this self-help tool will reduce the reliance on direct enquiries and rejection of applicants. See example: insert GD checker 

Testing knowledge through quiz

### Limitations
This is an expanding list of compiled limitations based on problem statements we came across along our journey:
1. The eligibility criteria needs have a fixed set of criteria/logic, and therefore dynamic assessment criteria (such as a write-up in an appeal) cannot be built in
2. There is no submit button. If you require your respondents to submit in their results after they have been assessed to have passed or failed,  please use [FormSG](https://www.transformationoffice.aic.sg/digital-tools/ogp-tools/FormSGsgID/).
