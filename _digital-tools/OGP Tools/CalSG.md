## CalSG (Integrated with FormSG)
### About the tool 
CalSG is an appointment booking system to easily publish available time slots for your audience to book using a public link. This is a function that has been integrated with [FormSG](https://www.transformationoffice.aic.sg/digital-tools/ogp-tools/FormSGsgID/), and therefore maintains the easy drag, drop and modular formatting.
