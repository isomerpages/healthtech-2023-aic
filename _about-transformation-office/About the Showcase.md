### Why Was This Website Created? 
This website was birthed as an end product from Transformation Office's (TO) participation in the HealthTech Sprint 2023, that was conducted by the team from Open Government Product (OGP). Through a Product Accelerator Workshop during the Sprint event, TO and some divisional representatives got hands-on experience with using various OGP tools, including Isomer which was used to create this site.


### What will this website be used for? 
The Transformation Office (TO) will be using this website to upload content such as bite sized tips & quick tips that AIC staff can use to improve their productivity at work. 
Guidelines and Policies will still remain housed within the Intranet, only accessible by AIC Staff.
